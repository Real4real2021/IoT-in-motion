# IoT-in-motion
brings together IoT motion detection and machine learning to monitor and keep records of the position as well as physical exertion of athletes on a field.

Scenario:
A high school soccer team is looking to increase productivity while training, the indiviaul skill of the players is evident but the need arises to fine tune team work
as well as gain insite as to how well suited each player is in their respective roles, ie, is it more or less physically straining for one player in one postition on the 
feild as opposed to another.

This program makes use of a combination of keras, OpenCv with Python, as well as Cutomtkinter. Each with their own specific function, keras, a neural network library, 
allows for data retention as well as modeling. OpenCV allows the program to make use of video inputs whether it be from a live feed or pre-recorded file. And Customtkinter,
provides the program with a modern graphical user interface (though not yet included in this repository)

The hardware necessary for this program consists of IoT cameras which will help with ploting the players position on a plane, a digital thermometers as well as heartrate monitors 
which will be kept on the individual person throughout practice.

The expected result is as follows, the hear rate monitor and thermometer feed data to keras program while the cameras help plot each players position which will then be 
translated to a sort of mini map with each individuals results displayed along side their respective charater model or point. The importance of the data is user specific, 
this will determine how the data will be displayed for interpertation, for example, one could use it to compare two players who play the same role to see who is most
suitable for a up coming event, or it could be used for the purpose of indiviual improvement, to see where and why mistakes were made on a finite level. This descrection 
can also help build more accurate and applicable criteria for data collection in future versions of the program. 

Constaints;
As this is a 3 month old program the orgininal scripts for this  have been lost during a drive issue, as of 20/10/2022, I've been working to recreate and republish what I can in section to document 
the projects progression. In the mean time I will make 4 phases the prototype available and hope to update soon.
